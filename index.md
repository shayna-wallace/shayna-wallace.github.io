* Enhanced Artifacts and Narratives (Mobile Applications, SQLInjection Program, and College Databases)

My name is Shayna and I'm a Computer Science major at SNHU graduating in May 2022.

During my Computer Science Capstone, I was given the opportunity to enhance three artifacts from previous courses. The artifacts I chose was a set of JUnit tests for mobile applications, a SQLInjection Program, and a sequence and class diagram of a college system software. Below is the link of my code review of these three artifacts.
