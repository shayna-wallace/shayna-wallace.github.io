## Self-Assessment

Completing my coursework throughout the program and developing the ePortfolio has helped me showcase my strengths in creating Junit tests that function correctly, my strengths in enhanced security via secure coding, and my strengths in database creation and maintenance. Developing the ePortfolio has shown there are benefits in creating one. An ePortfolio allows you to focus on your skills and strength and showcase them. It also allows you to assess what you have learned throughout the years and combine all of your knowledge in one central location. Developing an ePortfolio has helped me see what areas I excelled in and how I can use those areas of excellence to market myself to future employers and help me know what areas of Computer Science I would best work in.

The coursework throughout the program has shaped my professional goals and values. Those professional goals are to increase my core skills, grow my professional network, become an expert in my field, advance in the company, continually learn new industry tools and skills, and more. The professional values are integrity, responsibility, strong work ethic, honesty, reliability, adaptability, self-motivation, flexibility, and positivity, to name a few. I feel as though my professional goals and values will help prepare me to enter the Computer Science field and make me more employable. Throughout my journey at SNHU, I have learned so many skills and have been introduced to new learning and ways of thinking.

In my journey, one important skill I learned that will help prepare me for the Computer Science field is collaborating in a team environment. A course I took that exposed me to team collaboration was a Collaboration and Team course I took in 21EW3. I learned how to collaborate on a software project with my fellow classmates within this course. We had to work on a Jukebox software, and each one of us contributed to the software by adding different songs, albums, and pieces of code to form a unified software. In this course, I also learned how to use Bitbucket, a web-based Version Control repository. 
Another skill I learned was communicating with stakeholders. I learned this skill in a Software Development Lifecycle course I took in 20EW6. In this course, I learned about the stages of SDLC, agile development, best practices, and ethics on the SDLC. In the class, I learned the roles of Scrum Master, how to create test cases, developer roles, project management tools, and the roles of the Project Owner. The product owner is the project's key stakeholder. I learned how to communicate with the stakeholder to ensure the product owners' requirements were being met and any delays or changes were being communicated timely. Another important skill I learned was Data Structures and Algorithms. I learned this skill in a Data Structure and Algorithms course I took in 20EW2. I learned how to develop code while using graphical user interfaces. I learned algorithmic design and how to solve problems.

Software engineering and database was an important skill. I took a Software Reverse Engineering course in 21EW2 and an Introduction to Structured Database Environment in 20EW4. Software reverse engineering taught me how to reverse engineer code to make new software products, enhance the efficiency of software components, and recreate code. The database environment course exposed me to SQL, creating a database, using CRUD functions, analyzing queries, data manipulation, and management. Finally, the last skill I learned and one of the most essential skills is security. I took a Secure Coding course in 21EW1. This course taught me the importance of creating secure code and constantly develop with security in mind. I learned to identify security vulnerabilities, develop a security policy for a company to follow, and mitigate risks to software and data.

In my capstone project, I enhanced three artifacts: a set of JUnit tests for mobile applications, an SQLInjection program, and a sequence and class diagram of a college software system and its classes and attributes. The enhanced artifacts focused on software design and engineering, algorithms and data structure, and databases. All three artifacts showcase my ability to enhance current code and software and create code and software from scratch. I improved my JUnit tests for the software design and engineering category by adding more assert methods, comments, and program descriptions. 

For the algorithm and data structure category, I improved my SQLInjection program. I expanded its complexity by researching SQLInjection prevention methods and then implemented a method. This enhancement focused on security and helped protect against vulnerabilities. Finally, I used SQL language for the database category to create two databases for a college system. For this artifact, there initially wasn't any code at all. I took the requirements from a diagram and used them to create functional databases.

All of my artifacts fit together in showcasing my ability to review my code, plan enhancements, follow through with those enhancements, improve and expand the project/code, and create databases. It shows my ability to review my work and ability to identify areas of improvement. I'm able to show my skills and growth. This helps my ePortfolio have a range of artifacts that fit into crucial categories within the Computer Science field. I can show and discuss where the artifacts started and are now. It's imperative to show growth as Computer Science is an ever-learning field. 


My name is Shayna and I'm a Computer Science major at SNHU graduating in May 2022.

During my Computer Science Capstone, I was given the opportunity to enhance three artifacts from previous courses. The artifacts I chose was a set of JUnit tests for mobile applications, a SQLInjection Program, and a sequence and class diagram of a college system software. Below is the link of my code review of these three artifacts.
