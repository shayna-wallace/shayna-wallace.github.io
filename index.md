## Self-Assessment

Completing my coursework throughout the program and developing the ePortfolio has helped me showcase my strengths in creating Junit tests that function correctly, my strengths in enhanced security via secure coding, and my strengths in database creation and maintenance. Developing the ePortfolio has shown there are benefits in creating one. An ePortfolio allows you to focus on your skills and strength and showcase them. It also allows you to assess what you have learned throughout the years and combine all of your knowledge in one central location. Developing an ePortfolio has helped me see what areas I excelled in and how I can use those areas of excellence to market myself to future employers and help me know what areas of Computer Science I would best work in.

The coursework throughout the program has shaped my professional goals and values. Those professional goals are to increase my core skills, grow my professional network, become an expert in my field, advance in the company, continually learn new industry tools and skills, and more. The professional values are integrity, responsibility, strong work ethic, honesty, reliability, adaptability, self-motivation, flexibility, and positivity, to name a few. I feel my professional goals and values will help prepare me to enter the Computer Science field and make me more employable. Throughout my journey at SNHU, I have learned so many skills and have been introduced to new learning and ways of thinking.

In my journey, one important skill I learned that will help prepare me for the Computer Science field is collaborating in a team environment. A course I took that exposed me to team collaboration was a Collaboration and Team course I took in 21EW3. I learned how to collaborate on a software project with my fellow classmates within this course. We had to work on a Jukebox software, and each one of us contributed to the software by adding different songs, albums, and pieces of code to form a unified software. In this course, I also learned how to use Bitbucket, a web-based Version Control repository. 
Another skill I learned was communicating with stakeholders. I learned this skill in a Software Development Lifecycle course I took in 20EW6. In this course, I learned about the stages of SDLC, agile development, best practices, and ethics on the SDLC. In the class, I learned the roles of Scrum Master, how to create test cases, developer roles, project management tools, and the roles of the Product Owner. The product owner is the project's key stakeholder. I learned how to communicate with the stakeholder to ensure the product owners' requirements were being met and any delays or changes were being communicated timely. Another important skill I learned was Data Structures and Algorithms. I learned this skill in a Data Structure and Algorithms course I took in 20EW2. I learned how to develop code while using graphical user interfaces. In addition, I learned algorithmic design and how to solve problems.

Software engineering and database was an important skill. I took a Software Reverse Engineering course in 21EW2 and an Introduction to Structured Database Environment in 20EW4. Software reverse engineering taught me how to reverse engineer code to make new software products, enhance the efficiency of software components, and recreate code. The database environment course exposed me to SQL, creating a database, using CRUD functions, analyzing queries, data manipulation, and management. Finally, the last skill I learned and one of the most essential skills is security. I took a Secure Coding course in 21EW1. This course taught me the importance of creating secure code and constantly develop with security in mind. I learned to identify security vulnerabilities, develop a security policy for a company to follow, and mitigate risks to software and data.

In my capstone project, I enhanced three artifacts: a set of JUnit tests for mobile applications, an SQLInjection program, and a sequence and class diagram of a college software system and its classes and attributes. The enhanced artifacts focused on software design and engineering, algorithms and data structure, and databases. All three artifacts showcase my ability to enhance current code and software and create code and software from scratch. I improved my JUnit tests for the software design and engineering category by adding more assert methods, comments, and program descriptions. 

For the algorithm and data structure category, I improved my SQLInjection program. I expanded its complexity by researching SQLInjection prevention methods and then implemented a method. This enhancement focused on security and helped protect against vulnerabilities. Finally, I used SQL language for the database category to create two databases for a college system. For this artifact, there initially wasn't any code at all. I took the requirements from a diagram and used them to create functional databases.

All of my artifacts fit together in showcasing my ability to review my code, plan enhancements, follow through with those enhancements, improve and expand the project/code, and create databases. It shows my ability to review my work and ability to identify areas of improvement. I'm able to show my skills and growth. This helps my ePortfolio have a range of artifacts that fit into crucial categories within the Computer Science field. I can show and discuss where the artifacts started and are now. It's imperative to show growth as Computer Science is an ever-learning field. 


## Code Review

During my Computer Science Capstone, I was given the opportunity to enhance three artifacts from previous courses. The artifacts I chose were a set of JUnit tests for mobile applications, an SQLInjection Program, and a sequence and class diagram of a college system software. Below is the link to my code review of these three artifacts.

# Enhanced Artifacts and Narratives

A. Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?

B. Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and 
abilities in software development? How was the artifact improved?

C. Did you meet the course objectives you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage 
plans?

D. Reflect on the process of enhancing and/or modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did 
you face?


* ### Mobile Applications

The artifact I enhanced for category one (software design and engineering) is a set of Java projects that included JUnit tests for three different mobile applications. There are three Java projects, Appointment, Contact, and Task. These 3 Java projects are also what the mobile application is. An appointment application, a contact application, and a task application. I created the Java projects/classes, and in each project/class, coded the requirements needed for that mobile application. Once the requirements have been made, I need to test them to ensure they function correctly. To accomplish that, I then created JUnit tests to test the requirements. This artifact was created for a Software Test, Automation,  & QA course that I took in 2021(21EW4).

One of the main reasons I selected this item was because I enjoyed that course, and it piqued my interest in possibly having a career as a software tester. Since I will be interested in that profession, I wanted to enhance my skills and improve the project as it would be helpful and vital in my growth and journey to be a software tester. The components of the artifact that showcase my skills and abilities are my JUnit test. You are able to see that I'm capable of creating tests that test the mobile application's requirements. You can also see that I can create and code the application's requirements correctly with no errors. I was able to develop software requirements for the mobile application. I then took those requirements and combined them with my skills in JUnit test creation, all while using the code coverage tool provided in Eclipse. 

JUnit testing is a skill used by those in the Software QA Tester industry. Those in the Software QA Testing industry must test software, debug code, and improve the usability of the software program. JUnit tests consist of writing and running tests to ensure the software requirements are met. This helps you to detect errors and bugs in the code early. My skills and abilities with this artifact showcase my software design skills in providing computer solutions in the form of JUnit testing and code coverage that helps the software industry deliver products that meet industry goals and standards by having software that meets clients' requirements with no bugs and errors.

The artifact was improved by adding comments for lines of code that explain their purpose and the added descriptions for each Java project that explains the purpose of the application and tests. I also added a updateAppointment to the AppointmentService so customers could update appointments instead of either deleting existing appointments or adding a new appointment. I also added a updateAppointment test to ensure a customer can indeed update an appointment. Finally, I added more specific test cases that tested the requirements and gave accurate results. 

Overall, I was able to meet my planned enhancements. However, I did have trouble improving the code coverage for the Appointment Java project. The enhancing of the artifact was an eye-opener. I was able to see my strengths as well as weaknesses. I now know what areas I need to improve, which is good to know since it will help my growth and help me become a better software tester. What I learned the most was the importance of creating correct code that works as intended. It's vital to create code that looks great and works and functions as intended. If the code is not correctly written, it can still run with no errors, but the correct results or task will not be produced, rendering the software unusable. The main challenge I faced was code coverage. I wanted to improve the coverage for the Appointment Java, but I was unsuccessful. Despite the challenge, I fully intend to keep working on it until I can improve it.

* ### SQLInjection Program

The artifact is a SQL Injection program. The program is intended to catch SQL Injections in progress, prevent them by blocking them, and then display a message that there was a suspected SQL Injection. This artifact was in a secure coding course I took in 21EW1. The reason why I selected this artifact was that it focused on security and creating secure code. It's crucial in today's society to develop and have secure code to help protect sensitive information and prevent vulnerabilities. This artifact's component that showcases my skills and abilities is my correct use of the escape all user input method. I was able to implement the technique correctly and prevented an SQL Injection. This shows my security mindset skills in anticipating future vulnerabilities and then creating prevention methods. A hacker can use malicious code to exploit the software; therefore, we must implement secure code when designing the software. Therefore, we must always design with security in mind from the beginning. 

My skills show that instead of waiting for a vulnerability to happen and then fixing it, I incorporated secure code throughout my program. I accomplished this by using a SQL prevention method called "Escape All User Supplied Input." The escape all user supplied input works by escaping the users' input before it is put into the query. This helps block and prevent SQL Injections from happening, preventing attackers from stealing confidential data and stopping data breaches. My skills and abilities with the artifact showcase my software design, security mindset with enhanced security, and my problem-solving skills using data structures and algorithms to ensure the software does not get exploited. 

The artifact was improved by adding comments for lines of code that explained their purpose, the added description of the use for the program, and explained what the escape all user input method is. Finally, I added more escape all user method code to the program to cover other data areas, like ID and PASSWORD. Before, I only had created code for the NAME portion of the data. I was able to meet most of my planned enhancements. However, I did have trouble implementing other SQL Injection prevention methods, like the use of prepared statements and use of stored procedures.

The process of enhancing this artifact showed me the importance of secure coding and that this is an area I need to continually work in to build my skills and knowledge in creating secure code. It's essential to know all possible SQL Injection prevention methods and to be able to implement them all successfully. The main challenge I faced enhancing this artifact was implementing a different SQL Injection prevention method. 

* ### College Databases

The artifacts are a sequence diagram of a college system and a class diagram of the components; and classes of a college system, along with its attributes. The sequence diagram is how staff or students would use the college software system to register for classes, and the class diagram shows the components that are needed for the college system so that it is functional and meets requirements. This artifact was created in an Object-Oriented Analysis Design class I took in 21EW4. I took this artifact paired it with the knowledge and skills that I learned from my Intro to Structured Database Environment class that I took in 20EW4. 

I selected this artifact because it was one of my favorite classes that I took. I enjoyed seeing the thought and process that went into building a "blueprint" for software. I also selected this artifact because it had no code at all. This allowed me to create code for the artifact and then build and create a database. The components of the artifacts that showcase my skills and abilities are that I was able to create SQL code that produced a database from scratch. I was able to use the correct SQL code to create a database, and then I was able to create and enter data into a table within the database. I was able to maintain the database by using CRUD operations. CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. This allows you to create databases and tables, retrieve data, modify any data/tables, and then delete any data when needed. I was able to use my skills in database creation and the tools in MySQL Workbench to create and develop a solution and working environment for those in the Database Administration industry. Those in the Database Administration industry use their skills and knowledge to store and organize data in a software. They do database design and perform monitoring, as well as other tasks. My skills and abilities with this artifact showcase my database design and management.

The artifacts were improved because I took the diagrams, studied them, and then laid them as the foundation for my future databases and data. I then took that information from the diagrams and created two databases. Next, I took the class diagram and their classes and the attributes and created tables that matched the class diagram. After creating my databases and tables, I then filled those tables with data and did queries. I took artifacts with no code and no system, then created code for it and finally a workable and manageable database for a college system. 

Yes, I was able to meet the course objectives I planned to meet with the enhancements. In addition, I was able to accomplish each goal within this enhancement. When I created this artifact, I learned the importance of taking your time and thoroughly checking your work. When creating a database, tables, and adding data, it's imperative that you enter each code/data correctly. Spelling is a significant factor in database creation and maintenance because if you misspell anything and don't notice it, there's a chance when you conduct a query search that, you will not be able to find the data you are looking for. I faced the overall challenge of carefully entering data and ensuring everything was spelled correctly before running my code.
